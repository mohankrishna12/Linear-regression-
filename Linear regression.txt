MACHINE LEARNING :
  1. Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data to make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. 

  2. It enables computers to find patterns, improve from experience, and perform tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning.

BASED ON THE GIVEN DATA MODELS ARE CLSSIFIED INTO:
    1. SUPERVISED MODEL
    2.UNSUPERVISED MODEL
    3.REINFORCEMENT MODEL

IN SUPERVISED LEARNING WE HAVE :
    1.LINEAR REGRESSION
    2. LOGISTIC REGRESSION 
    3. DECISION TRESS

LINEAR REGRESSION:
                
                  Linear regression helps us find the straight line that best fits a set of data points, showing how one value changes with another

IF we want to predict your exam score based on how many hours you studied. The more you study, the higher your score might be, and this relationship can be shown as a straight line on a graph.

The input (hours studied) is called the independent variable.

The output (exam score) is called the dependent variable.

The line is represented by the formula: Y= MX +C


where :
        y = predicted output (exam score),

        x = input (hours studied),

        m = slope (how much score increases per hour),

        c = intercept (score when hours studied is zero).

The goal is to find the values of m and c that make the line as close as possible to all the actual data points.

Once the line is found, you can use it to predict the score for any number of study hours.
